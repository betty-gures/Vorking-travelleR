## Resources/Inspiration

## Idea

You are a **cashier** in a foreign country of your choice. 

**Step 1:** As you pass the goods of the customers through the checkout, on the computer screen you see the name of that product- in both languages.  Also, you have buttons on the screen, that you press and the audio of the right pronunciation is played. 

**Step 2:** Your checkout computer is malfunctioning sometimes. In such cases, you have to type in the **name of the goods/quantity/price** manually. This way you practice the words you learned before.

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype really needs to function or to prove your point.

- Hand tracking while passing goods from the checkout
- The computer screen of the checkout displays the names of goods (UI for hand tracking, buttons to press)

**Stretch goals:** 

These are features that are nice to have, and that you might implement if you have extra time, or in the future.

- Polishing
- Small talk witch customers

* This repository will be updated on a regular pace, for one week (9th November 2022).
* At the end of the week, a beautiful, running and error free VR protoype will be delivered.
