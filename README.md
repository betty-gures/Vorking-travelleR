## Idea

I would like to try implementing the passthrough effect by simulating the bowling game, but there might be some power-ups, to change the gameplay, speed the ball, slow the ball, friction, etc. The track might also be different with some barriers to avoid.

## Features

**Core features:** 

These are the features that your prototype really needs to function or to prove your point.

- The system shall provide an AR experience through the passthough effect
- The user shall pick up the desired bowling ball
- Bowling balls shall be different in weight
- The user shall throw the bowling ball towards obstacles
- The track shall provide interesting level design

**Stretch goals:** 

These are features that are nice to have, and that you might implement if you have extra time, or in the future.

- The user shall pick the bowling balls through hand tracking/ pinching from bowling ball holes  
- Polishing physics
- Level System and changing tracks

* This repository will be updated on a regular pace, for one week (2nd November 2022).
* At the end of the week, a beautiful, running and error free VR protoype will be delivered.
